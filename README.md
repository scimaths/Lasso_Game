# Lasso_Game
Repository for CS101 Project - Lasso game in C++

The aim of the game is to catch the projectile being launched. There are different features, like multiple projectiles and posion-projectiles, those which shouldn't be caught.
To run the game, one would need [SimpleCPP](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp).
